Before the year was out, he covered&nbsp;</span><span>Cold Water</span><span>&nbsp;(Major Lazer and Justin Bieber),&nbsp;</span><span>Self-Control</span><span>&nbsp;(Frank Ocean) and&nbsp;</span><span>Beamer Boy</span><span>&nbsp;(Lil Peep).&nbsp;The same year, he sang and produced the single&nbsp;</span><span>18</span></p><p><span>Landon Cube then took off with his May 2017 single&nbsp;</span><span>Beachtown</span><span>.&nbsp;He wasted no time in releasing other singles like&nbsp;</span><span>19, Legend</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Mad of the New World</span><span>&nbsp;which followed the same year.&nbsp;Landon’s single&nbsp;</span><span>Driving My Car</span><span>&nbsp;appeared in January 2018 and the same year he contributed to Louis Luv’s song&nbsp;</span><span>Quel est le Luv</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Driving My Car</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Beachtown</span><span>&nbsp;leading in the most watched video stakes on its Youtube channel.&nbsp;Along with Lil Skies, he was featured in&nbsp;</span><span>No Jumper</span><span>&nbsp;– a September 2016 podcast by Adam22.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is Landon Cube net worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>It’s still early days for the young talent, but he’s slowly making his mark in the competitive world of music.&nbsp;His salary is not yet known but his wealth has been estimated at $125,000 by some sources.&nbsp;With more musical efforts, the amount may soon become an insignificant figure for the artist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Landon Cube stands at a height of 5 feet 8 inches and sports a slim build.&nbsp;Details on his other measurements are not available at this time.&nbsp;However, the American musician has light brown hair and light brown eyes as distinguishing physical characteristics.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikkaOxsLqMnKybnV2XtrB5wKCcZq%2BZoLZutMSinqGsXaOytXnMrqqim18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flandon-cube-bio-age-wiki-height-net-music.html&text=Landon%20Cube%20%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%2c%20Music&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flandon-cube-bio-age-wiki-height-net-music.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flandon-cube-bio-age-wiki-height-net-music.html&title=Landon%20Cube%20%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%2c%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flandon-cube-bio-age-wiki-height-net-music.html&title=Landon%20Cube%20%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%2c%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flandon-cube-bio-age-wiki-height-net-music.html&title=Landon%20Cube%20%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%2c%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flandon-cube-bio-age-wiki-height-net-music.html&description=Landon%20Cube%20%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%2c%20Music" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lesedi-breaks-the-internet-with-breath-taking-bikini-body.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lesedi Breaks The Internet With Breath-Taking Bikini Body">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kit-harington-emilia-clarke-hug-emmys-after-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke Hug at Emmys After-Party 2019">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
