Once heralded as the savior of the Cleveland Browns, Mayfield’s journey has been filled with highs and lows, leading many to wonder what exactly happened to the promising quarterback. This article delves into the twists and turns of Baker Mayfield’s career, examining the factors that have influenced his trajectory in the NFL.</p><h2 id=early-promise-and-success-BYNBgIiNAY>Early Promise and Success</h2><p>Baker Mayfield burst onto the NFL scene with a bang. Drafted by the Cleveland Browns, he was seen as a beacon of hope for a franchise that had long struggled to find a franchise quarterback. Mayfield’s rookie season was impressive, as he broke the NFL record for touchdown passes by a rookie and led the Browns to a significant improvement in their win-loss record.</p><ul><li>Set rookie touchdown pass record with 27 TDs</li><li>Named PFWA Rookie of the Year</li><li>Helped Browns improve from 0-16 to 7-8-1</li></ul><h2 id=signs-of-trouble-BYNBgIiNAY>Signs of Trouble</h2><p>Despite a strong start, Mayfield’s performance began to waver in his second season. The Browns, with heightened expectations, failed to live up to the hype. Mayfield’s sophomore slump was characterized by a regression in his statistics and decision-making on the field.</p><ul><li>Increased interception rate</li><li>Decreased quarterback rating</li><li>Browns missed the playoffs with a 6-10 record</li></ul><h2 id=injury-woes-BYNBgIiNAY>Injury Woes</h2><p>One of the critical factors that have impacted Mayfield’s career is injuries. His playing style, which often involves extending plays outside the pocket, has left him susceptible to hits that have led to various injuries, affecting his performance and availability on the field.</p><ul><li>Battled through rib, hand, and shoulder injuries</li><li>Underwent surgery for a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder</li><li>Injuries impacted his throwing mechanics and confidence</li></ul><h2 id=coaching-changes-BYNBgIiNAY>Coaching Changes</h2><p>Stability is crucial for a quarterback’s development, and Mayfield has had little of it. The Cleveland Browns have undergone several coaching changes since Mayfield joined the team, each bringing new systems and philosophies that he has had to adapt to.</p><ul><li>Played under multiple head coaches and offensive coordinators</li><li>Constant changes in offensive schemes</li><li>Lack of continuity may have stunted his development</li></ul><h2 id=public-perception-and-media-scrutiny-BYNBgIiNAY>Public Perception and Media Scrutiny</h2><p>Mayfield’s brash personality and on-field antics have often drawn media attention, not all of it positive. His outspoken nature and willingness to engage with critics have sometimes overshadowed his play on the field, leading to a polarized public perception.</p><ul><li>Frequent subject of sports talk shows and social media debates</li><li>Scrutiny over on-field performance and off-field comments</li><li>Pressure from being the face of a franchise with a passionate fanbase</li></ul><h2 id=2020-season-a-glimmer-of-hope-BYNBgIiNAY>2020 Season: A Glimmer of Hope</h2><p>In the 2020 NFL season, Mayfield seemed to turn a corner. Under new head coach Kevin Stefanski, he led the Browns to their first playoff appearance since 2002 and their first playoff win since 1994. Mayfield’s play was more efficient, and he appeared to be on the path to becoming the leader Cleveland had hoped for.</p><ul><li>Guided Browns to an 11-5 record</li><li>Reduced interceptions and improved quarterback rating</li><li>Won a playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers</li></ul><h2 id=2021-season-the-downward-spiral-BYNBgIiNAY>2021 Season: The Downward Spiral</h2><p>However, the optimism from the 2020 season was short-lived. The 2021 season saw Mayfield struggle with injuries and inconsistencies. The Browns failed to make the playoffs, and questions about Mayfield’s future with the team began to surface.</p><ul><li>Played through injuries, affecting performance</li><li>Browns finished with an 8-9 record</li><li>Speculation about Mayfield’s future with the Browns intensified</li></ul><h2 id=trade-to-the-carolina-panthers-BYNBgIiNAY>Trade to the Carolina Panthers</h2><p>In a move that shocked many, the Browns decided to trade Mayfield to the Carolina Panthers in the 2022 offseason. This marked a new chapter for Mayfield, but also raised doubts about his ability to be a starting quarterback in the NFL.</p><ul><li>Traded for a conditional draft pick</li><li>Joined a Panthers team with its own quarterback struggles</li><li>Faced competition for the starting job</li></ul><h2 id=struggles-in-carolina-BYNBgIiNAY>Struggles in Carolina</h2><p>Mayfield’s tenure with the Panthers was tumultuous. He battled for the starting position but faced challenges with a new team and system. His performance was inconsistent, and he was eventually bened from the starting role.</p><ul><li>Inconsistent play led to benching</li><li>Dealt with another injury, further complicating his season</li><li>Released by the Panthers after just one season</li></ul><h2 id=whats-next-for-baker-mayfield-BYNBgIiNAY>What’s Next for Baker Mayfield?</h2><p>As Baker Mayfield looks to the future, his career stands at a crossroads. Once a promising young star, he now faces the challenge of rebuilding his reputation and finding a new team willing to give him a chance to prove himself once again.</p><ul><li>Free agency and the search for a new team</li><li>Potential as a backup or competition for a starting role</li><li>Opportunity to reset his career and prove doubters wrong</li></ul><h2 id=statistical-overview-BYNBgIiNAY>Statistical Overview</h2><p>Mayfield’s career statistics reflect the ups and downs he has experienced in the NFL. From record-setting rookie numbers to injury-plagued seasons, his stats tell the story of a quarterback who has shown flashes of brilliance but has struggled to maintain consistency.</p><table><tr><th>Season</th><th>Team</th><th>Games Played</th><th>Touchdowns</th><th>Interceptions</th><th>Passer Rating</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>Browns</td><td>14</td><td>27</td><td>14</td><td>93.7</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>Browns</td><td>16</td><td>22</td><td>21</td><td>78.8</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>Browns</td><td>16</td><td>26</td><td>8</td><td>95.9</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>Browns</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>13</td><td>83.1</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>Panthers</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>74.4</td></tr></table><h2 id=faq-section-BYNBgIiNAY>FAQ Section</h2><h3 id=what-injuries-has-baker-mayfield-dealt-with-BYNBgIiNAY>What injuries has Baker Mayfield dealt with?</h3><p>Mayfield has dealt with several injuries throughout his career, including a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder, rib injuries, and a hand injury.</p><h3 id=why-did-the-browns-trade-baker-mayfield-BYNBgIiNAY>Why did the Browns trade Baker Mayfield?</h3><p>The Browns traded Mayfield due to a combination of his inconsistent performance, the acquisition of Deshaun Watson, and Mayfield’s desire for a fresh start elsewhere.</p><h3 id=can-baker-mayfield-still-be-a-starting-quarterback-in-the-nfl-BYNBgIiNAY>Can Baker Mayfield still be a starting quarterback in the NFL?</h3><p>While Mayfield has faced challenges, he has also shown the potential to be a starting quarterback.
