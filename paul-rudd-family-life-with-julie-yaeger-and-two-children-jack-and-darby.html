I make jokes to a series of eye rolls."&nbsp;</p><p id=e9EtydxvDxv data-wc=88>It wasn't until Paul's son Jack turned 15 that he was able to fully grasp what his dad does for a living. Recalling an adorable story to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>NME</a>, Paul explained that when Jack was five, "He went to a movie theatre with his friends, and there was a poster that I was on, in the lobby. They all just assumed I worked at the movie theatre, which I felt was very cute. I never corrected him. When he was 15, I think he finally put it all together."</p><p id=esafIyFdpd data-wc=10><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Meryl Streep's 45-year marriage to husband Don Gummer</a></p><p id=ehviZ7W7dyG data-wc=19><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building: inside Selena Gomez's sweet friendship with 'best friends' Steve Martin and Martin Short</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d0188d5ec39-paul-rudd-son-z.jpg><p id=e9cemhnI5Nt data-wc=23>As for his daughter, Darby has watched a number of Paul's films, and he's even left some easter eggs in them for her.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9GxDLWhiZ8 data-wc=73>"At first when [my daughter] was very young, I used to think, is it going to be weird when my daughter is old enough and she sees this movie?
