He was born on May 16, 1969, in San Francisco, California, and was raised in La Jolla, a suburb of San Diego.</strong></p><p>Carlson attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where he earned a degree in history. After graduation, he began his journalism career as a fact-checker for Policy Review, a conservative political journal.</p><p>In 1994, Carlson was hired as a reporter by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He later worked as a staff writer for the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, before joining CNN in 2000 as a co-host of the show “The Spin Room.”</p><p>Carlson gained wider recognition in 2001 when he joined the Fox News Channel as a co-host of the show “Fox & Friends Weekend.” He later went on to host several other shows on the network, including “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” which debuted in 2016.</p><p>Throughout his career, Carlson has been known for his conservative political views and his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. He has been a vocal critic of both Republicans and Democrats, and has been known to take controversial positions on a variety of issues.</p><p>In 2003, Carlson published his first book, “Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News.” The book offered a behind-the-scenes look at the world of cable news and was well-received by critics.</p><p>In 2018, Carlson became the subject of controversy when he made comments on his show that were widely criticized as racist and anti-immigrant. Despite calls for his firing, Carlson remained on the air, and his ratings actually increased in the months following the controversy.</p><p>In addition to his work in journalism, Carlson has been involved in a variety of other projects. He co-founded the conservative news site The Daily Caller in 2010, and he has also appeared as a commentator on several other TV shows and networks.</p><p>Carlson has been married to his wife, Susan Carlson, since 1991, and the couple has four children. He is also an avid hunter and fisherman and has written several articles and books on these topics.</p><p>In recent years, Carlson has become increasingly influential in conservative political circles. His show, “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” has become one of the most-watched programs on cable news, and he has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2024.</p><p>Despite his success, Carlson has also been the subject of criticism from those who disagree with his views. He has been accused of promoting conspiracy theories, spreading misinformation, and promoting divisive rhetoric.</p><p>Nevertheless, Carlson remains one of the most prominent conservative voices in America today, and his influence is likely to continue to grow in the coming years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tucker Carlson Children: Meet Tucker Carlson’s Children</h2><p>Tucker Carlson is a well-known media personality and commentator who is married to Susan Thomson Carlson, formerly known as Susan Andrews. The couple first met while attending St. George’s School, where Susan was the daughter of the school’s headmaster and priest. They were married on August 10, 1991, in a ceremony held at the school chapel.</p><p>Tucker and Susan are proud parents to four children, and their names are Buckley Carlson, Hopie Carlson, Dorothy Carlson, and Lillie Carlson.</p><p>In addition to being a prominent figure in the media, Tucker has also been open about his personal struggles. He has dyslexia, which is a learning disorder that affects reading ability, and he is left-handed. Despite these challenges, Tucker has been able to achieve great success in his career and remains a respected commentator and journalist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2snKOVp3qkrdGlqqimXZi1qrjDq5ynZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftucker-carlson-children.html&text=Tucker%20Carlson%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Tucker%20Carlsons%20Children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftucker-carlson-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftucker-carlson-children.html&title=Tucker%20Carlson%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Tucker%20Carlsons%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftucker-carlson-children.html&title=Tucker%20Carlson%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Tucker%20Carlsons%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftucker-carlson-children.html&title=Tucker%20Carlson%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Tucker%20Carlsons%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftucker-carlson-children.html&description=Tucker%20Carlson%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Tucker%20Carlsons%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./356212-vanessa-bryant-scolds-evan-rachel-wood-for-labeling-kobe-a-rapist-after-his-death-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanessa Bryant Scolds Evan Rachel Wood For Labeling Kobe A Rapist After His Death">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tristan-yaptengco-net-worth-190105.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tristan Yaptengco Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
