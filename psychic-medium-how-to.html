One of the main thoughts that kept interrupting my ability to hold it together was, "I'll never get to call her out of the blue again and ask her how to make matzo ball soup or tell her about my latest byline or hear about her most recent mahjong get-together." Little did I know, I'd connect with her constantly — just in an ethereal way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the years since her passing, we've communicated through a handful of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>medium readings</a>, the most recent of which was with Fleur Leussink, a world-famous psychic medium, writer, intuition teacher, and author of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Moving Beyond: Access Your Intuition, Psychic Ability and Spirit Connection</a>. According to Leussink, connecting to loved ones in the spirit world is a wonderful way to know that we're not alone. She explained that we all have the ability to move beyond the physical world and access our inner intuition, psychic ability, and spirit connection to give ourselves the gift of communication with the people we miss whenever we want.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, check out seven of Leussink's best tips for becoming your own psychic medium.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-honor-your-inner-voice></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Honor Your Inner Voice</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Leussink's book is divided into three parts: intuition, psychic ability, and spirit connection (i.e. mediumship), and that order was a very conscious decision on her part because connecting with yourself is the first step to connecting with people you love in the spirit world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even if the destination or goal is wanting to connect to your loved ones, it's still going through your own spirit, so all information — whether it's about you, someone else, or connection to spirit — it all has to go through your own spirit," she explained. "This is your source. We can't actually be good mediums or have connection to the spirit world if the connection itself isn't in place first."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For that reason, Leussink said the foundation of any intuitive work is to create space for listening to the internal or your inner voice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The ability to tune into and trust yourself has benefits beyond chatting with your departed loved ones. In fact, after more than a decade of readings — many of which have been for successful celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople — Leussink found that in the area these people were "winning," they always followed their internal voice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If someone was making really great moves in their career, I could tell they were listening to their own gut on it — same in love and romance," she noted.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In other words, they had an unflinching connection to self.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-acknowledge-intuition-suppressors></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Acknowledge Intuition Suppressors</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are so many reasons people suppress their intuition and so many ways in which they do, said Leussink. A few of the most common:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Fear:&nbsp;</strong>Whether that's rooted in family or societal beliefs.</li><li><strong>If your own internal feedback was never validated:&nbsp;</strong>Perhaps you feel like you never got to listen to yourself over others.</li><li><strong>Busyness:</strong>&nbsp;"We're also so busy,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on our phones all the time</a>, numbing out," said Leussink. "If we fill every waking moment of our day with stuff, there's not a single moment to be like, 'Ooh. Is a thought I'm having maybe not my own? Or is there a feeling I'm having that maybe originates from somewhere else?'"</li><li><strong>Absence of embodiment:&nbsp;</strong>People often believe that in order to have intuitive or spirit communication moments, they have to be out of their body or meditate into some astral plane far, far away, said Leussink. However, she believes it's actually quite the opposite. "If you can't be in your body and you can't feel your feelings and don't know from where those feelings are originating, then you're also not going to feel the subtle connections to spirit," Leussink suggested.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-create-space-to-connect></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Create Space to Connect</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We usually think all metaphysical practices, including mediumship, require sitting on a meditation pillow, using sage, or lighting a candle, but doing so could actually hinder your ability to connect.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Your rational mind is going to be like, 'Are they there? Are they there?'" said Leussink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, she recommended considering where in your life you go into a truly receptive state.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We know through scientific studies that when our brain waves are in theta waves, which are slow and open," explained Leussink. "We know that when we have these big insights and intuitive, seemingly mystical thoughts, we're in the theta state. When we do repetitive activities in our life — driving, doing dishes, folding laundry, in the shower, running, or playing an instrument — we go there too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you're in the midst of one of these activities, you can consciously call in a connection to your loved one, said Leussink before adding, "You can say, 'No expectations, but I'd love you to join me.' Then, do that repetitive activity, and your brain will naturally slow down."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although you won't want to set your expectations too high — and you might end up needing to do this a couple of times — this exercise creates space for you to receive, creates the calmness that you need to receive, and sets the intention that you'd like to receive, according to Leussink. "You'll have set the stage, and they will join, and you'll have an experience," she added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-suspend-disbelief></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Suspend Disbelief</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you feel like you've been connecting with a loved one but are struggling to trust that it's real, consider zeroing in on a mantra that Leussink herself used when she was facing the same challenge early on in her career: "Suspend disbelief."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Leussink actually committed to doing this for six months, telling herself, "I'm going to stop questioning every time something happens, and I'm going to stop rationalizing it away, so that I can allow some momentum to build."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Leussink, it turned out to be the "most liberating experience." That's why she advised anyone looking to connect with loved ones to do their best to hit pause on interruptions from the rational mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In the moment, just experience it if you can," she suggested. "If you can't find that little bit of faith required to bridge the gap, you can't have the experience, so it's a little bit of a catch-22."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-look-at-patterns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Look at Patterns</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to differentiate what's real from what's imagined, Leussink recommended reflecting — in retrospect — on your patterns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you feel like you're experiencing something or receiving something, ask yourself, 'What state of mind am I usually in? How does it show up?'" she advised. "All spirit communication is going to follow a pattern for you. As the connection to spirit connects to your own soul, this information rises into your rational mind and your physical experience through the same pathway every time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That pathway will be uniquely your own. For example, some people might get goosebumps, noted Leussink. Others might feel like something's in the room or have a voice in their head. All of these things will be slightly different than if it's happening because you created it or you just happened to be emotionally triggered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By reflecting on your experiences, you can tell the difference between what a spirit connection might feel like versus how your anxiety or wishful thinking shows up.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When anxiety shows up in your body, it tends to show up in the same way every time," she pointed out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The way you experience it isn't necessarily going to be in the same way as someone else.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-set-expectations></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Set Expectations</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the main misconceptions Leussink said trips people up in the beginning is the idea that you need to see your loved one in order to have connected with them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Very few mediums talk to people who've passed in such a way that they're standing in the room, and you see them and hear them," emphasized Leussink. "It doesn't happen that way. I get flashes of images, little bits here and there. Sometimes, it feels very much like playing Charades. You're putting together a story."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You might experience a subtle shift of emotion or physical sensation, get a flash of a daydream-like image, or you'll hear a thought out of nowhere, Leussink added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keep-going></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keep Going</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you've started honing your mediumship ability, taking it to the next level just requires continued exploration. Ultimately, you'll be able to get to a place where you use your intuition in everyday life, trust it, and feel confident.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nurturing this ability can have unexpected, long-term downstream effects as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When people have the experience of being connected to something larger than themselves, life changes," said Leussink. "You're not as afraid of passing or of life. There's also a moment when you realize, 'Oh, I have much more creative control over life than I thought I did.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like anything, if you stick with it and give yourself room to grow, it just gets easier.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a language," she added. "You have to put time into learning a new language, and that's ultimately what this is: a new language."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvPrLCcoJmYeq6xw6KspmWYpMRuwM4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpsychic-medium-how-to.html&text=Become%20a%20Psychic%20Medium%20with%20These%20Expert%20Tips&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpsychic-medium-how-to.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpsychic-medium-how-to.html&title=Become%20a%20Psychic%20Medium%20with%20These%20Expert%20Tips" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpsychic-medium-how-to.html&title=Become%20a%20Psychic%20Medium%20with%20These%20Expert%20Tips" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpsychic-medium-how-to.html&title=Become%20a%20Psychic%20Medium%20with%20These%20Expert%20Tips" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpsychic-medium-how-to.html&description=Become%20a%20Psychic%20Medium%20with%20These%20Expert%20Tips" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./benny-medina-net-worth-278042.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Benny Medina Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ashlynn-chong-net-worth-209709.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashlynn Chong Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
