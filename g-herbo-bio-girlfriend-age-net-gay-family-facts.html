His town was known as Terror Town due to the prevalence of gang activity that was prevalent in the locality.&nbsp;He grew up listening to artists such as Jadakiss, Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Young Jeezy and Chief Keef.&nbsp;He and fellow rapper and friend Lil Bibby would later start their rap careers after being inspired by their rap heroes.</span></p><p><span>Herbo and Lil Bibby both belong to the NLMB fraternity The name draws on different sources of inspiration.&nbsp;The four letters N, L, M, and B come from merging two gang names: No Limit (a faction of the Almighty Black P. Stone gang) and Muskegon Boyz (a faction of the Gangster Disciples).&nbsp;However, the initials NLMB also stand for “Never Leave My Brethren” for the Herbo NLMB fraternity.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Songs and Mixtapes</span></strong></h2><p><span>G Herbo and Lil Bibby got some well-deserved attention for their song&nbsp;</span><span>Kill the Shit</span><span>.&nbsp;The song has since been viewed over 15 million times and counts on YouTube.&nbsp;Even the famous Canadian animator, Drake, described them as the future.&nbsp;In February 2014, Lil Herb dropped&nbsp;</span><span>Back to Fazoland,</span><span>&nbsp;his debut mixtape which was dedicated to his friend Fazon Robinson.&nbsp;He was the first of Herb’s friends to lose their lives to gun violence.&nbsp;The project received many positive reviews, and Fader magazine praised Herbo’s rich content and lyrical dexterity.</span></p><p><span>Herb went on to feature on top hit songs like Nicki Minaj, Common and Chance The Rapper.&nbsp;In the same year of release, XXL Magazine chose him for their Show & Prove segment of the 2014 Freshmen Class issue.&nbsp;He also surprised his fans by releasing an unexpected second mixtape for 2014. It was titled&nbsp;</span><span>Project Pistol</span><span>&nbsp;P.</span></p><p><span>2015 was a very big year for the rapper, which kicked off with a report on chef Keef&nbsp;</span><span>Faneto’s remix.&nbsp;</span><span>It also involved fellow rappers King Louie and longtime friend Lil Bibby.&nbsp;Lil Herb proved to be a marketing genius when he wasn’t included in XXL’s 2015 promo, instead of reacting with a bang like most rappers would, he released a single titled&nbsp;</span><span>XXL</span><span>.&nbsp;The magazine praised the rapper and praised the song.&nbsp;Subsequently, he was included in the 2016 freshmen list.</span></p><p><span>Herb announced his third mixtape in August 2015 titled&nbsp;</span><span>Ballin Like I Am Kobe,</span><span>&nbsp;released in honor of his friend Jacobi Herring.&nbsp;In September of the same year, he signed with Cinematic Music Group and officially changed his stage name to G Herbo.&nbsp;</span><span>Ballin Like Me, I’m Kobe</span><span>&nbsp;was released under Cinematic on September 29 to critical acclaim and positive reviews.</span></p><p><span>He closed the year with a single titled&nbsp;</span><span>The Lord Knows,</span><span>&nbsp;for which he collaborated with Joey Bada$$, a rapper from New York.</span></p><p><span>On April 4 the following year, G Herbo met with SXSW where he announced the title of his debut album.&nbsp;He released a single in March titled&nbsp;</span><span>Yeah I Know.&nbsp;</span><span>Then two singles for the album in the middle of the year entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Remonter</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Drop.&nbsp;</span><span>On October 10, he released the music video on a fourth single.&nbsp;He also did a song with DJ Twin,&nbsp;</span><span>They Know Us</span><span>&nbsp;With Lil Bibby and Sean Kingston.</span></p><p><span>Since announcing his debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Humble Beast,</span><span>&nbsp;G Herbo was set to release a fourth mixtape,&nbsp;</span><span>Strictly 4 My Fans,</span><span>&nbsp;and an updated version of his debut mixtape&nbsp;</span><span>Welcome to Fazoland 1.5.&nbsp;</span><span>He also released singles&nbsp;</span><span>I Know, Red Snow, I Like Everything</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>4 Minutes From Hell, Pt.5.</span></p><h2><strong><span>G Herbo Girlfriend Gay Rumors Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Herb has been dating Ariana Fletcher since 2014. Ariana, who has had her share of heartache, says she feels comfortable and at peace with Herb until she recently took to Instagram to post a message saying that she is now single and no longer romantically linked to G Herbo.&nbsp;There was no specific reason for the breakup, however, the nature of the message points to infidelity.</span></p><p><span>She’s the same age as the rapper and owns her own business called&nbsp;</span><span>Kyche Extensions,</span><span>&nbsp;a name she coined from the names of her late brother Kyle and his nephew.</span></p><p><span>The rapper showed no gay streaks.&nbsp;Ariana, however, dated a 14-year-old girl.&nbsp;On November 19, 2017, Ariana announced on her Instagram account that she was carrying Herb’s child.&nbsp;He was apparently so thrilled by the news that he gave her a sexy black Range Rover.</span></p><p><span>G Herbo still has a lot to give to the music industry as it is still in its infancy.&nbsp;It is valued between 1 and 2 million dollars.</span></p><h2><strong><span>G Herbo Family Facts</span></strong></h2><p><span>There isn’t much family history or scandalous news to know about G Herbo.&nbsp;Other than his closest friend, Lil Bibby, his friends who he dedicated two of his albums to, and his girlfriend Ariana, there isn’t much else to know about him.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGifXZ2ys67OZpmip12ctrO4xaugnqaUYq6osYynnK1ll5bGbrLApqClsV2brqTA0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fg-herbo-bio-girlfriend-age-net-gay-family-facts.html&text=G%20Herbo%20Biography%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%2c%20Gay%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fg-herbo-bio-girlfriend-age-net-gay-family-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fg-herbo-bio-girlfriend-age-net-gay-family-facts.html&title=G%20Herbo%20Biography%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%2c%20Gay%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fg-herbo-bio-girlfriend-age-net-gay-family-facts.html&title=G%20Herbo%20Biography%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%2c%20Gay%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fg-herbo-bio-girlfriend-age-net-gay-family-facts.html&title=G%20Herbo%20Biography%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%2c%20Gay%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fg-herbo-bio-girlfriend-age-net-gay-family-facts.html&description=G%20Herbo%20Biography%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%2c%20Gay%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gregory-harrison-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gregory Harrison Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./forrest-preston-net-worth-50499.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Forrest Preston Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
