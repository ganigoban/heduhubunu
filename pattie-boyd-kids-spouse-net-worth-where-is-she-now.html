She was asked to work as a model by a client who worked for the British monthly magazine.</span></p><span>When Boyd started out as a model photographer in 1962, she appeared on several Vogue covers and worked the runway for top designers like Ossie Clark.&nbsp;Other famous models of her time followed her fashionable style of mini skirts, straight hair and wide eyes.</span><p><span>Pattie Boyd met George Harrison, the Beatles’ lead guitarist, while appearing in the British musical comedy film&nbsp;</span><span>The Night of a Tough</span><span>&nbsp;Schoolgirl Day.&nbsp;Her modeling career took the spotlight when they became romantically involved.</span></p><p><span>Arousing an early interest in photographyIn the 1960s she bought a camera and became a member of the Royal Photographic Society.&nbsp;She snapped several photos of well-known musicians, friends, and of course, her famous boyfriends and husbands.&nbsp;However, Boyd never really did professional photography until 2004.</span></p><p><span>In 2007 she published a memoir entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Wonderful Tonight: George Harrison, Eric Clapton and I</span><span>&nbsp;which was a UK bestseller upon publication.&nbsp;Boyd published another book, which she titled&nbsp;</span><span>Wonderful Today: The Autobiography</span><span>&nbsp;Where She Reveals Her Life With Both Her Former Husbands.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, this former English model is a photographer invaluable, as her well-documented photos of her two former superstar husbands were released for public exhibition in February 2005 and May 2016 at galleries in San Francisco and Liverpool, respectively.</span></p><p><span>The collection included sights of historical moments, tours of the legendary musical group, the Beatles, George Harrison, Eric Clapton and their intimate moments, among others.</span></p><h2><strong><span>your fortune</span></strong></h2><p><span>The 5ft 7in icon who started her career in 1962 was undoubtedly a stroke of luck as her net worth is around $20 million.&nbsp;It’s one of many proofs that being genetically blessed pays off.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is her spouse and what children?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Pattie Boyd has been featured in two marriages to award-winning rock ‘n’ roll musicians.&nbsp;Her third marriage is to a not-so-well-known personality, a property developer named Rod Weston</span></p><p><span>Her first marriage was to famed&nbsp;</span><span>Beatles</span><span>&nbsp;lead guitarist George Harrison in January 1966. The couple met in March 1964 and began dating.&nbsp;They married in 1966 and divorced a decade later in 1977.</span></p><p><span>Harrison cites Pattie Boyd as his main influence on his musical career as she served as his muse on the hits;&nbsp;</span><span>something</span><span>&nbsp;from the 1969 album&nbsp;</span><span>Abbey Road</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>I need you, blue for you</span><span>&nbsp;from the 1965 album&nbsp;</span><span>Help!&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>don’t care.</span></p><p><span>Harrison also confessed that she even broadenedhis outlook on life.&nbsp;Unfortunately, due to Harrison’s infidelity and alcoholism, the foundation of their marriage became overwhelmed.&nbsp;In 1977 they were divorced.</span></p><p><span>After they broke up, Boyd started dating another famous musician, Eric Patrick Clapton, whom she married in 1979.&nbsp;He was a close friend and frequent music collaborator with Harrison.&nbsp;Eric Clapton was in love with Pattie Boyd when she was still dating Harrison.&nbsp;To keep an eye on Boyd, Eric Clapton dated one of her sisters, Paula.</span></p><p><span>He openly declared his affection for her through the classic&nbsp;</span><span>Layla,</span><span>&nbsp;a song describing his undeserved love for Boyd.&nbsp;Eventually they became lovers, but their blissful marriage would prove to be a nightmare, with Eric Clapton repeating the cycle Pattie Boyd left Harrison for.&nbsp;The debacle of their romance took its toll on Boyd, who began to battle alcoholism.</span></p><p><span>After their 1989 divorce, Boyd immediately entered a rehab program to get her life back.&nbsp;After that she turned to photography in the following years.</span></p><p><span>Pattie Boyd didn’t walk down the aisle again until 2015. With two highly publicized failed marriages, she couldn’t be blamed for taking so much time.&nbsp;She met her now husband Rod Weston in 1991, who dated for decades before finally deciding to tie the knot in Chelsea, London in April 2015.</span></p><p><span>Although Pattie Boyd has made several attempts, including IVF, to conceive her own child in past marriages, she has never had a child by her.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is she now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Pattie Boyd had given up modeling way back in the ’70s.&nbsp;She is now considered a popular culture icon.&nbsp;After retiring from active show business, Boyd got involved in charity, teaming up with actress and model Barbara Bach, who has been married to Beatle member Ringo Starr since 1981 in West Sussex, southern England, with her current one husband Rod Weston.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiokanBqrGMm6aynF2gtqW%2FjKynqK2jmnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16uLTEq5xmoaNiwKmxjKemsGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpattie-boyd-kids-spouse-net-worth-where-is-she-now.html&text=Pattie%20Boyd%20Kids%20Spouse%20Net%20Worth%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpattie-boyd-kids-spouse-net-worth-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpattie-boyd-kids-spouse-net-worth-where-is-she-now.html&title=Pattie%20Boyd%20Kids%20Spouse%20Net%20Worth%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpattie-boyd-kids-spouse-net-worth-where-is-she-now.html&title=Pattie%20Boyd%20Kids%20Spouse%20Net%20Worth%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpattie-boyd-kids-spouse-net-worth-where-is-she-now.html&title=Pattie%20Boyd%20Kids%20Spouse%20Net%20Worth%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpattie-boyd-kids-spouse-net-worth-where-is-she-now.html&description=Pattie%20Boyd%20Kids%20Spouse%20Net%20Worth%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ripp-flamez-net-worth-221655.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ripp Flamez Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./natasha-lyonne-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natasha Lyonne Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
