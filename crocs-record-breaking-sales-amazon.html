But instead of changing into skinny jeans, you decide the leggings you typically wear to the gym are perfectly fine for bottomless brunch. It's not laziness, it's athleisure. And by 2015 standards, it's a daring fashion choice — one you're likely still getting used to since anything resembling sweatpants was once considered a major faux pas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Flash forward to today, however, and this uniform has become the norm. But stepping out in workout wear to grab breakfast was only the beginning, which makes us wonder: If so much of today's wardrobe qualifies as "athleisure," does the trend still exist? What does that word even mean nowadays?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well, it kind of depends on who you ask.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Melodie Jeng/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When COVID first hit in early 2020, and stay-at-home guidelines were enforced by the CDC, people were no longer dressing to make a statement. Instead, clothes were viewed as a source of comfort, and if something was too stiff or impossible to relax in, it was out. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>High-heel sales dropped by 71%</a> as shoppers began investing in comfier options such as Crocs, UGGs, sneakers, and even house slippers while wearing a<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> matching sweatsuit</a> meant you looked put-together that day. Even the mostfashionable people, like editors and influencers, were swapping out their blouses and 'real' pants for graphic tees and leggings. Office attirewas gone and athleisure took its place — and, according to celebrity trainer and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>The Sculpt Society</a>, Megan Roup, that spike wasn't all that surprising.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The explosion of [athleisure] is even more relevant today as most of us are working from home and the demand for a comfortable, stylish aesthetic has increased," she tells InStyle. "It's more common to see people wearing athleisure while running errands, grabbing a bite to eat, and even hopping on a Zoom."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's worth noting, however, that the "athleisure" Roup is referring to — AKA the athleisure of today — is not exactly the athleisure of yesteryear. In its early years, athleisure was as much a verb as it was a synonym, meant to describe wearing workout clothes beyond yoga or spin class. It translated to pairings such as 'joggers' (re: sweatpants) and heels, sneakers (re: Nikes) and dresses, and designer leggings (re: anything by Lululemon) with a leather jacket or under a dress. Essentially, the idea was to be comfortable and slightly sporty, while still adhering to the societal expectation of dressing to impress. Models, in particular, loved amping up these active essentials, and the look coincided with another trend that has seemingly lost all meaning, "off-duty style."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Robert Kamau/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, the norm has become dressing to feel your best, with an extra emphasis on comfort. Athleisure is no longer the trend of the moment but, instead, a lifestyle — a key part of our day-to-day look that makes living a little more tolerable amidst current events. There's no longer a need for runway-ready elements, such as super strappy sports bras (which can be a pain to pull on), leather details, or impractical footwear. Seeing someone <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>style leggings as pants</a> longer feels surprising or rule-breaking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What began as a distinct class of performance activewear for fitness lovers has become its very own look and phenomenon, from high-end to fast fashion," proclaims fashion stylist to the stars, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lindsay Flores</a>, the style director of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Respin</a> by Halle Berry. "Not to mention," she adds, "it is something that we all partake in, even on days when we have no plans of working out. [Athleisure is] an entire category of functional clothes worn to make fitness, comfort, and style synonymous."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So what, by these modern definitions, does athleisure look like today? It's wearing yoga pants with a bulky sweatshirt, platform sneakers, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>layered necklaces</a>. Or styling your exercise dress with chunky socks and loafers. It's the many oversized, matching sets you have in your wardrobe, which instantly work for all the things — lounging, working from home, or going for a run. Today's athleisure is comfortable but elevated, sporty, but not in an 'I-just-finished-up-at-the-gym' sort of way. Much like its predecessor, this way of dressing isn't lazy or haphazard — it's deliberate and sleek, but at the same time, feels somewhat effortless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When intentional, today's version of athleisure can be the same mix of chill yet put-together as jeans and a button-down — something that celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mickey Freeman</a> agrees with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In a relatively short span of time, athleisure has evolved from an often improvised look that involved mixing and matching pieces into a specific aesthetic that designers continue to reinterpret, and even incorporate into a single garment," says Freeman, whose star-studded clientele includes Keke Palmer, Lea Robinson, and Shannon Thornton. "[It] can be achieved in more than one way, such as wearing a spliced coat, where the top half is a hoodie and the bottom half is a cotton gabardine trench. Athleisure can also look like a velour sweatsuit with a luxe handbag and intricately strapped sandals."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In short, the world has moved onto athlivesure — the everyday aesthetic that's comfortable and practical, equipped for whatever the world throws at us, while still remaining cool and fun. It's not just one trend, but an element that has trickled into multiple areas of our lives, ensuring we're both relaxed and ready to go at the same time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, as fashion fans know, what's considered 'in' is always evolving — athleisure and athlivesure included. What, exactly, will this fitness-inspired aesthetic turn into next? Only time will tell. For now, though, we'll be clinging to our co-ords and yoga pants (that's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flared leggings</a> to all you Gen Z readers) and styling them accordingly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykvs6cqmaqlZi8s7CMm6memZueu6h50pqjnqtdlrqixs6n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcrocs-record-breaking-sales-amazon.html&text=How%20to%20Wear%20the%20Athleisure%20Trend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcrocs-record-breaking-sales-amazon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcrocs-record-breaking-sales-amazon.html&title=How%20to%20Wear%20the%20Athleisure%20Trend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcrocs-record-breaking-sales-amazon.html&title=How%20to%20Wear%20the%20Athleisure%20Trend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcrocs-record-breaking-sales-amazon.html&title=How%20to%20Wear%20the%20Athleisure%20Trend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcrocs-record-breaking-sales-amazon.html&description=How%20to%20Wear%20the%20Athleisure%20Trend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./influencer-beautyk-found-dead-age-22-police-suspect-foul-play.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Influencer BeautyK found dead age 22 as police suspect foul play: all we know">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-old-is-loki-in-thor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How old is Loki in Thor?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
